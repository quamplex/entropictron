# Entropictron

Entropictron is a free software context synthesizer and audio effect,
 still under development with no release yet.
Its aim is to produce a variety of sound textures that can
serve as background or contextual elements in music tracks.
It may be useful for ambient music, sound effects, film and
video production, game audio, and other multimedia projects.

Entropictron will be released under the GNU GPLv3 license as
a VST3 plugin (later LV2 and CLAP support is planned).

For version 1.0, the following features are planned:

- Noise generator with control over density, brightness, gain,
  filter type (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass), and stereo spread
- Crackle generator producing bursts with configurable rate,
  duration, number of bursts, burst shape, randomness, brightness, and stereo spread
- Glitcher (memory glitch effect) with parameters for probability
  , minimum and maximum jump size, segment length, and repeats
- Mixing of all modules, with automation support for all parameters
- Playback, Hold, and On modes, with Hold triggerable via MIDI
- Sidechain control for modulation of parameters
