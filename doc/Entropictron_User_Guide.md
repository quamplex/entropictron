### What is Entropictron

Entropictron is a [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
context synthesizer and audio effect. Entropictron can produce a variety of sound
textures that can serve as background or contextual elements in music tracks.
Useful for ambient music, sound effects, film and video production, game audio,
and other. Entropictron is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 (and later),
developed in C and C++, and utilizes the CMake build system. It can be used as an VST3 audio plugin.
Can run on GNU/Linux and Windows.

The name **Entropictron** derives from the root word *entropy*, which generally refers to something chaotic. 

### Block diagram

Entropictron consists of three primary modules: a noise generator, a crackle generator, and a glitch effect.
Each module can be tuned via its own set of parameters, and the processed
signals are finally mixed to produce the output sound. Here is the block diagram that
shows the general overview of the parts of Entropictron.
